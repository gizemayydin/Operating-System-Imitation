* Reads the instructions of processes from files.
* Can convert assembly language to binary and store it in the memory as a character.
* Reads these characters from memory and executes the operation.
* Process Images are used.
* Round Robin Scheduling is used.
* Makes context switch if necessary.
* Loads multiple processes in a limited memory.
* Can deal with I/O operations.
